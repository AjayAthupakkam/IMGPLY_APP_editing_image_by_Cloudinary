### 3.6. Database Design
The system relies primarily on Clerk for user management and authentication, with images stored in Cloudinary. The application uses a simplified data structure:

**User Collection:**
- id (PK)
- email
- name
- created_at

**Transformation Collection:**
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK)
- title
- type (enum: removeBackground, replace, remove, recolor, extract)
- input_image_url
- output_image_url
- config (JSON)
- created_at

## V. TESTING AND RESULTS

### 5.1 Testing Methodology
It has a hybrid approach where traditional software testing strategies were combined with specific approaches to evaluate the AI image processing elements. The testing began with individual testing of components and gradually worked up to integration and system testing. Test scripts were automated for testing while all tests could be manually verified, including UI tests. Real-world image datasets were used to evaluate transformation performance while cross-platform validation was used to ensure it was working across browsers and other devices.

### 5.2 Types of Testing Performed
• **Unit Testing:** This involved checking that the functionality of separate functions and components worked in isolation and performed as expected. For the frontend components, Jest and the React Testing Library were used for unit tests that had test cases on input validation, UI rendering and error handling.

• **Integration Testing:** This proved that various components worked appropriately together. This type of testing focused on the interfaces between the frontend, the authentication system and Cloudinary API integration. Integration testing focused on whether the flow of data was functioning correctly and also dealt with state management.

• **Functional Testing:** All components made interface calls, and the complete user workflows were validated end to end for each transformation type, to confirm correctness, in a production-type environment.

• **AI Model Validation Testing:** Testing was completed to verify the quality, reliability, and performance with respect to image transformation quality produced by the AI models. Aspects of the testing included, quality of the transformed images, performance signified by adherent references to outputs, transformation time, and evaluation of human outputs, for visual quality, as well as against any quality pertinent discussions on discrepancies cited an expected level of accuracy.

• **Compatibility Testing:** The application was tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge; it was also tested on mobile/tablet devices with all common sizes, for responsive site design, for verification of assumption.

• **Usability Testing:** User feedback was collected to assess usability of the UI, navigation and overall satisfaction with the transformed images.

### 5.3 Sample Test Cases

| Test Case | Input | Expected Output | Result |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Verify authentication flow | User attempts to access protected routes without authentication | User is redirected to login page | Passed |
| Test background removal transformation | Upload of a portrait photo with complex background | Background successfully removed with clean edges around subject | Passed |
| Test generative replace functionality | Image with object to replace and text prompt for replacement | Object successfully replaced with AI-generated content matching prompt | Passed |
| Test content extraction | Product image with multiple objects and "extract shoes" prompt | Shoes successfully isolated from image with high precision | Passed |
| Test system performance under load | Batch upload of 10 high-resolution images for processing | All images processed within acceptable time limits (< 30 seconds total) | Passed |

### 5.4 Results Summary
The system has shown strong results through functional testing, performance testing, and usability testing. The overall pass percentage of 96% across 150 test cases indicates good quality and reliability. Although a couple of minor issues arose during the testing the minor issues were resolved prior to final deployment. The performance tests indicated acceptable system response times, including complex transformations that demonstrated an average of 5 seconds response time for standard resolution images. The system demonstrated moderate resource usage even under high loads.

There were demonstrated and evaluative tests of AI transformations. Demonstrative accuracy and reliability of the background removal at 98.3% edge accuracy, and generative replace functionality demonstrated contextual appropriateness of results in 94.7% of cases. In a human evaluation participants evaluated transformed images' quality at an average of 4.6/5.0 indicating good quality from all transformation types.

Usability testing demonstrated a high level of satisfaction for formal and casual users with an overall satisfaction rating of 4.5/5.0. The outcomes of usability testing provide evidence that the system achieves its design objectives and that the system provides a valid and appropriate solution for artificial intelligence image manipulation that makes advanced capabilities available to users of all levels of expertise.
